# Ticketing

This project will be a system where users can create projects and tickets that correspond to tasks for the users to complete. Tickets will be specific whereas projects
Are larger in scope, and admins and project leaders have the ability to assign users to their projects. When a project is complete it should be marked off 
With relevant historical data and changes being stored. The app also has user authentication with hashed password encrpytion and persistant data that can be created, read, update, and deleted.
